# Gender-Recognition-based-on-voice-signals
The Gender Recognition Based on Voice Signals project leverages MATLAB to classify individuals' gender based on their vocal characteristics. By analyzing features such as pitch, formant frequencies, and voice harmonics, the system can accurately distinguish between male and female voices. MATLABâ€™s signal processing tools allow for efficient extraction and processing of these acoustic features, ensuring reliable performance. This technology can be applied in various fields, including security systems, voice assistants, and telecommunication, where automatic gender identification can enhance user experience and functionality.
